- The `aura` subcommand under neo4j-cli mirrors the standalone aura-cli surface but does NOT carry a duplicate `skill` group — install agent skills via `neo4j-cli skill install` at the top level.
- `credential` lives at the top level of neo4j-cli (not nested under `aura`) so credentials apply across every subcommand that talks to Aura.
- All read commands accept `--output json|table`. Write commands print confirmation text only; pipe-friendly output requires explicit `--output json` where supported.
- Async resource operations (instance create/resize/destroy) accept `--await` to block until the resource reaches a terminal state.
- The `version:` line in an installed SKILL.md reflects the binary that wrote it. Run `neo4j-cli skill check` after upgrading to detect drift; v1 reports drift only — re-run `skill install` to refresh.
