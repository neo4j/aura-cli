name: neo4j-cli
description: Use this skill when the user asks to manage Neo4j resources from the command line via neo4j-cli — provisioning Aura instances, listing tenants, creating credentials, working with deployments, or installing agent skills. neo4j-cli is the super-CLI that bundles aura-cli (under the `aura` subcommand) plus a top-level `credential` group and a `skill` group for installing/removing/listing/checking the embedded agent-skill bundle. Commands follow `<resource> <action>` form (e.g. `aura instance list`), take at most one positional argument, and support `--output json|table` on read commands.

## Gotchas

<!-- Hand-written gotchas inlined into the generated SKILL.md "Gotchas" section. Edit this file (not bundle/SKILL.md) and re-run `go generate ./...`. -->

- The `aura` subcommand under neo4j-cli mirrors the standalone aura-cli surface but does NOT carry a duplicate `skill` group — install agent skills via `neo4j-cli skill install` at the top level.
- `credential` lives at the top level of neo4j-cli (not nested under `aura`) so credentials apply across every subcommand that talks to Aura.
- All read commands accept `--output json|table`. Write commands print confirmation text only; pipe-friendly output requires explicit `--output json` where supported.
- Async resource operations (instance create/resize/destroy) accept `--await` to block until the resource reaches a terminal state.
- The `version:` line in an installed SKILL.md reflects the binary that wrote it. Run `neo4j-cli skill check` after upgrading to detect drift; v1 reports drift only — re-run `skill install` to refresh.
